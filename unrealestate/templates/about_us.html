        <h2>Expanding on real estate investments</h2>
        <p align="justify">Aftermarket real-estate may offer great investment
            opportunity, but comes with hassles for buyers and
            sellers. Real estate is an emotional, engaging and
            tangible asset class, but it is presented and sold in
            uninspiring ways. How might real estate investors
            get a better chance to connect with the investments
            they make, and know what they are putting their
            money into without much manual due diligence?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Taking the experience economy to experiential
            asset classes like real estate is a no brainer. It
            is time we break down big financial decisions
            into smaller, digestible chunks that allow us to
            better diversify our assets and enjoy investing
            by exploring the tangible side of where we put
            our money. It is ironic how much we care about
            experience in the small things we purchase everyday,
            yet how willingly we accept a subpar
            experience whenever large sums of money are
            involved? Turning big financial decisions such
            as investing in real estate into small and more
            exciting chunks that come more naturally to us
            is a tremendous and little-exploited opportunity.</p>
        <p align="justify">Drawing inspiration from crowdfunding, virtual
            reality technology and the inherent preference
            in Asia for real estate investment, unrealestate
            offers a delightful and intuitive avenue to grow
            one's wealth by backing attractive aftermarket
            real estate sales harnessing the power of group
            buying. This empowers anyone to own a piece
            of desirable real estate, be it a holiday home or
            a high-end condomimium downtown and earn
            rental income on it immediately. Also, investors
            have the opportunity to take advantage of the
            healthy returns on real estate commonly seen
            in Asia. Virtual walkthroughs facilitate property
            evaluation and build an emotional connection
            between asset and the group of buyers. Crowd
            based decision-making and an aftermarket for
            ionvestors to sell their stakes to oher users help
            make investments in property highly tradable,
            with the additional intangible benefit of owning
            a high-status, lifestyle asset class.
